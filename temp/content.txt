##Andersen ## 
Hans Christian Andersen (Danish: Hans Christian Andersen Hans Christian Anersen[*], 2 April 1805 - 4 August 1875) was a Danish fairy tale writer and novelist. He succeeded in delighting children in many countries during his lifetime. His poems and stories have been translated into more than 150 languages. His works have provided the inspiration for several films, plays, ballets, and animations."[1]

## Life ## 
Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark, the son of a shoemaker. The name Hans Christian Andersen was given to him by his godparents[2] when he was baptised in the Lutheran Church. Andersen's family was poor enough that his grandmother worked as a cleaning worker in a hospital, which had a major impact on his upbringing. His mother, a devout Lutheran, instilled in him a pure Protestant faith that honoured Jesus, while his father nurtured his imagination and education through puppet theatre and reading, often telling him old stories and The Arabian Nights. His father's sudden death during his childhood left the family home empty, and Andersen worked in a factory at an early age while his mother washed clothes. In 1819, he travelled to Copenhagen with dreams of becoming a theatre actor, but he had to abandon his dreams when his voice became hoarse after a period of metamorphosis. Moreover, poverty prevented him from receiving a formal education, and his scripts were returned by theatre companies with poor grammar and spelling, causing him to suffer so much emotional distress that he contemplated suicide. Fortunately, he was sponsored by Jonas Collin, a member of the Danish Parliament, who recognised his talent as a writer, and enrolled in a Latin school, but after five years, he left the school due to conflicts with the headmaster, who disliked his poetry, and enrolled in the University of Copenhagen in 1828. After writing several plays and novels, Andersen showed his talent as a writer and won the favour of the literary community with The Improvised Poet (1834). In 1835, he began to write children's stories, which were so well received that even adults read them. However, some literary critics were harsh in their criticism, saying, "A writer of his calibre, who wrote The Improvised Poet, writes stories that deceive children." By 1872, he had published a total of 160 fairy tales, all of which became well known and earned him a pension and a postage stamp featuring Andersen's illustrations. At the age of 62, he was made an honorary citizen of his hometown of Odense and died in 1875 in the capital, Copenhagen. His funeral was attended by the King and Queen of Denmark. On 2 April 2005, the bicentenary of Andersen's birth was celebrated, and a bicentenary website was launched."[3]

## Characteristics of Andersen's literature ## 
Andersen's literature was strongly influenced by the fact that he was the son of a poor cobbler. The Matchmaker's Girl is based on Andersen's mother, who grew up in poverty and had to beg. The Snow Queen is based on Andersen's childhood memories of being orphaned when his father returned from fighting in the Napoleonic Wars and died of a nervous breakdown on a frosty night, leaving him to believe that the "Snow Queen" was taking him away, and The Ugly Duckling is a literary expression of the way in which Andersen was treated by his family, even after he became a writer.
